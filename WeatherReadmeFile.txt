1. This is a Python program where I have created an application to obtain 5 current weather parameters from the website provided.
2. This is done by Entering the latitude and longitude. These values are given via the console and not a GUI.
3. Run the weather.py file.
4. Enter the appropriate values for latitude and longitude available in this index file: http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/index.xml
5. The output is provided with the link of the location and 5 weather parameters.
6. If one of the parameter is not present then "-" is displayed.
7. The program will also ask whether these weather parameters have to be refreshed(yes or no).
8. The session disconnects after the complete execution.

NOTE: There is a warning that is thrown, upon discussing with professor he told it can be neglected if the program is working otherwise. He also told that the sockets need not be used.
